# Template For A Lab In DevNet Learning Labs 

(The title above should match the "Title" in the JSON file)

Lorem ipsum... in a very short sentence - **less than 25 words** - state in **general terms** what this lab is about). For example: Learn how to create a script that works with technology X. Learn how to use the advanced features of tool Z. 

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to show how to:

* Open an account blah-blah
* Send an API call blah-blah
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque.
* Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel.
* Eu malesuada laoreet, et tincidunt arcu, tellus placerat, integer proin.

## Prerequisites

Use bullet points or sub headings to list any prerequisites, such as tools that need to be installed or other labs that should be completed before starting this lab.

## Sub Heading 2 (Optional)

For any intro text that might introduce the steps use a short paragraph less than 100 words.

### Sub Heading 3 (Optional)

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque diam, per phasellus natoque etiam vel et. Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel, facilisis lorem fermentum tellus, amet veniam soluta ut magna leo, metus donec aliquam. Lorem nunc ut eleifend quam, lacus magna sit integer orci nam, hendrerit risus quam ante vivamus feugiat, praesent faucibus, pretium donec. Aenean augue

* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet


## Step 1. Lorem Ipsum Dolor 

Step 1 is the first major step. It should appear on the first page (1.md). Use action words that are imperatives, such as "Create...", "Understand...", "Set Up...", "Open...", "Define...", etc.

### Images 

Use the following markdown syntax to add an image:

> `![](/posts/files/lab-dir-and-id/assets/images/image_filename.png)` 

where `lab-dir-and-id` is the name of the directory containing the subdirectory assets/images.

For example, here is a test.png image:

![](/posts/files/basic-template/assets/images/test_image.png)

The publishing engine requires `/posts/files` in the path in order to parse the assets and images.

> NOTE: The image will not be viewable in your markdown editor nor in Github. The image will be viewable in the Learning Lab Previewer tool, and the [Production](https://learninglabs.cisco.com) site where we publish the labs for public use and the [Staging](https:learninglabs.cisco.com:8867) site for internal Cisco use.

If you need substeps and sequence matters, use numbered steps. Use bullet points if the sequence of steps does not matter. If the substeps amount to more than 9 steps, break up the procedure into separate major steps (put each major step on its own page).

To do blah-blah (it's often good to have a short intro sentence to substeps):

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, massa ligula tellus pellentesque diam, per phasellus natoque etiam vel et. Pellentesque ornare elit ullamcorper pellentesque vel
  > Note: This is a note.
2. Here's a substep with an inline image.
  ![](/posts/files/basic-template/assets/images/test_image.png)
3. Eu malesuada laoreet, et tincidunt arcu, tellus placerat, integer proin augue quis in, luctus sit integer interdum pellentesque consectetuer.
