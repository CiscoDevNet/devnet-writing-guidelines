# DevNet Writing Guidelines (Public)

Welcome to the DevNet Writing Guidelines. This repo contains DevNet's guidelines on creating Learning Labs, code samples, and setting up sandboxes for Learning Labs. 

The topics below are some of the topics of most interest to newcomers.  For more the complete set of writing guidelines see this repo's [wiki](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki) pages.

## Learning Labs

The source Markdown for all of DevNet's Learning Labs are stored in the repos of the [CiscoDevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization. 

If you want to create and publish a Learning Lab on the DevNet site, you must commit the content and its associated files to a repo within the [CiscoDevNet](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet) organization.  The Markdown, images, JSON metadata, and so on must exist in a certain directory structure. 

### How do I author a Learning Lab?

See the wiki page: [How To Create A New Lab](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki/How-To-Create-A-New-Lab).

### Templates

There are two kinds of templates: one for Learning Labs and one for sample code. 

#### Learning Lab template

The Learning Lab template is stored in the following directory:

> https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/tree/master/labs

#### Sample code template

The template for code samples is here:
